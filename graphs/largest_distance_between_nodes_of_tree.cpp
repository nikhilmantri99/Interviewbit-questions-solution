//IMportant question:
//Basically we have to find the largest distance between two nodes of an undirected acyclic graph
// So we select any vertex first(here root),run a BFS and find a node at the farthest distance from it. This is one endpoint
//among the two nodes, now we run BFS starting from this node and find the longest distance of a node. This is our second node
// and the distance is the answer.

// Given an arbitrary unweighted rooted tree which consists of N (2 <= N <= 40000) nodes.
// The goal of the problem is to find largest distance between two nodes in a tree.
// Distance between two nodes is a number of edges on a path between the nodes 
//(there will be a unique path between any pair of nodes since it is a tree).
// The nodes will be numbered 0 through N - 1.
// The tree is given as an array P,
// there is an edge between nodes P[i] and i (0 <= i < N). 
//Exactly one of the iâ€™s will have P[i] equal to -1, it will be root node.

	//In this post, an efficient solution is discussed. 
	//We can find longest path using two BFSs. 
	//The idea is based on the following fact: 
	//If we start BFS from any node x and find a node with the longest distance from x, 
	//it must be an end point of the longest path. It can be proved using contradiction. 
	//So our algorithm reduces to simple two BFSs. First BFS to find an end point of the longest path and 
	//second BFS from this end point to find the actual longest path. 
	//For the proof of why does this algorithm works, there is nice explanation here Proof of correctness: 
	//Algorithm for diameter of a tree in graph theory.
